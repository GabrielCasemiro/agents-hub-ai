##Agents Hub IA 

Agents Hub IA is a repository of modular intelligent agents built with modern frameworks (like CrewAI).
The goal is to provide a hub of specialized agents that can automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, making them available both for local use and future integration into a SaaS platform.

- 🧩 Modular architecture – each agent lives in its own folder, isolated but reusable.
- 🛠 Shared tools – utilities (e.g., stock price fetcher, news scraper, flight search) are centralized so any agent can access them.
- 🌍 Scalable – easily add new agents for new domains.
- 💡 Practical use cases – from financial analysis to news aggregation and travel planning.

The first available agent is the Financial Analyst Agent (inspired by Luiz Barsi, Brazil’s most famous dividend investor), with more agents (News Fetcher, Flight Finder, etc.) coming soon.
